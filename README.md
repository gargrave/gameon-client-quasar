# GameOn Client (Quasar)

This is the "retired" front-end codebase for my GameOn app. It is a similar project to my [Gamr](https://github.com/gargrave/gamr) repo, albeit using my own Django REST Framework API in place of Firebase. I refer to it as "retired" because, unfortunately, I need to move onto other projects and I really don't have time to keep working on it.

I wanted to test out the [Quasar](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar) framework with this build. I did not get a chance to mess around at all with the building/exporting of native mobile versions, but the web version was really very nice to work with. It has tons of components, and the documentation is pretty solid. Overall, it's a shame I don't have the time to continue working on it, but such is life.

I don't think there is too much more to say about it. It's just a very small Vue/Quasar project that is receiving an honorable discharge.
